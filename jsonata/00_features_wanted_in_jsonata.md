## Here are some features that would be nice to have in jsonata

- Ability to chain multiple querries
  - Sometimes to achieve a goal it is easier to make a sequence of querries rather than have to compose all the desired outcome in a single query. Today we have to get the output of one query and feed it back into another. If a command line tool is used it adds to the complexity especially if some character escaping has to be considered. A sequence of transforms could be provided by delimiting each query like how yaml does it, i.e. `---`
